abstract = {There are now a wide variety of image segmentation techniques, some considered general purpose and some designed for specific classes of images. These techniques can be classified as: measurement space guided spatial clustering, single linkage region growing schemes, hybrid linkage region growing schemes, centroid linkage region growing schemes, spatial clustering schemes, and split-and-merge schemes. In this paper, each of the major classes of image segmentation techniques is defined and several specific examples of each class of algorithm are described. The techniques are illustrated with examples of segmentations performed on real images.}

abstract = {A threshold method based on statistical principles and heuristics is developed to detect boundaries in radiographic images. Each local region of the image containing a portion of boundary is characterized by a mixture of two (normal) intensity distributions. Thresholds are set dynamically according to local, rather than global, characteristics estimated from the observed intensity histograms. A program to implement the method has been written. Experimental results on cardioangiograms are presented to successfully demonstrate the feasibility of the method for low quality images. The method is insensitive to shading or gradually varying interference.}
